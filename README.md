## Description

Habit tracker os a web application that I developed to keep track of different habits that I want to keep track of. It has a calendar map inspired by the GitHub contributions map.

Users can create Habits to keep track of and they can mark that they completed them and the app will save the data on localStorage.

I may add backend and a database in the future if I decide to make the app work on several devices for users.

## Installation

You can clone this repository if you'd like to contribute to it or if you want to have your own version of the app.

The project has a main directory called frontend, you can go inside that directory using your terminal and run:

``` bash
npm run i
npm run dev
```

This will install the dependencies (React library) and then run the development server.

## Deployment

This app is deployed on Netlify and you can visit it following [this link](https://jpe-habit-tracker.netlify.app)
